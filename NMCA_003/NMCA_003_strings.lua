Mission Description:
    Briefing:
        In a nearby sector, one of your ships attempting to find safe territory is shot down, and the fleet commander instructs your commander to rescue the crew before they are killed off by the enemy (Aeon) forces on planet.
        You arrive there and discover that much of the planet is already in ruin; the UEF forces that were in the region are being killed off, and the Aeon are obliterating them in swath of merciless destruction.

    Mission 1:
        Intro:
            Cinematics start at small Aeon base, dialogue that the ship has to be somewhere close. The signal from the crashed ship is coming from the north. Camera moves to the north where the crashed ship is.
            You are sent there to defend the ship.

        Primary:
            First objectives are to defend the ship against the Aeon attack and destroy the Aeon base to the south.

            Few minutes later ally engineers fly in on the transports to scan and repair the ship. Soon you'll find out you will need to get specific crystals to repair the ship. There are 2 in this part,
            one close to the player's base, second behind the Aeon base.

            Reclaiming the crystals triggers the map expansion (since more crystals are needed to repair the ship) if player is fast, else there is a random Aeon attack (either Naval or Air attack) from the west,
            and few minutes after that the map expands to the second part.
                +-20 min on hard difficulty for the map to expand to the second part on it's own.
                Different dialogues when the map expands on it's own and when player manages to reclaim the crystals.

        Secondary:
            There's a small civilian settlement next to the Aeon base, objective to capture one of the buildings to get additional intel. This is assigned once the player scouts the settlement
                This will be used in the second part of the mission to get a free intel on (some defenses/factories, TBD)

        Bonus:
            Capture Aeon factory or engineer
            Build a shield over the crashed ship.
            All ally engineers repairing the ship survive.

        Unlocked Tech:
            T2 Static Shield - 3 minutes into the mission

    Mission 2:
        Intro:
            Cinematics start at player's ACU, "scanning area aroud for more crystals". Player is assigned to move to the west (that's where the attack came from) to reclaim 3 more crystals that are located there,
            and to deal with the Aeon bases before they are significant threat.

        Primary:
            Reclaim 3 more crystals to repair more ship's systems.

            After some minutes, cinematics to the off map at gating Aeon ACU.
                The ACU will keep building the base, so finishing the objectives faster will lead to less developed base in the next part of the mission.

            When player reclaims the crystals or several minutes later, Aeon counter attack coming from the north. This will expand the map to the north/main Aeon base.

        Secondary:
            Destroy 2 Aeon bases. This is no longer a primary objective.

        Bonus:
            Destroy over X Submarine Hunters (exact number in the script)
            Shoot down engineer drop from south base (this will cause one less enemy base in the final part)

        Unlocked Tech:
            Railgun boat - 2 minutes into the mission
            T2 Arty - 11 min into the mission

    Mission 3:
        Intro:
            Cinematics at the incoming attack from the main base (north-west).

            Frist orbital cannon will be on the north island.

        Primary:
            Defend the Aeon counter attack.

            After a momnet another primary objective to locate the orbital cannons is assigned.

            When both counter attack and orbital cannon is located the map will expand to the last part.

        Secondary:
            Defeat the enemy ACU, once player scouts it.

        Unlocked Tech:
            RAS - 2 min into the mission

    Mission 4:
        Primary:
            Destroy 4 Orbital cannon bases.
            North one has a base with the tempest, South one is spawned depending on if the engineer drop in M2 was shot down or not.

        Secondary:
            Destroy the Tempest.
            There's a Tempest being built in the North Orbital base.

        Bonus:
            Destroy the Tempest before it's completed.

        Unlocked Tech:
            TMD/TML - 1 min into the mission
            Field Engineer - 7 min into the mission
    
    Outro:
        Cinematics at the ship leaving the planet.
